# Pathology Detection in X-rays using machine learning
This project aims to detect pathologies from chest X-Rays using machine learning. Here i focus on a pathology called Cardiomegaly which is the enlargement of heart. I experimented with various densenet versions and the results can be found in the project.
Grad-CAM was used to provide a visual explanation for the model.
